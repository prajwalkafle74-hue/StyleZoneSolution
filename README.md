# My Part – Transaction/Payment Module (StyleZone Retail System)

## Description
I developed the transaction/payment feature for our group retail management system.
This module allows staff to record product sales, apply discounts (Regular, Student, VIP),
calculate tax (15%), and process different payment methods such as Cash, Card, and Online.

## Features
- Calculates total with discount and tax
- Handles cash payments and change
- Stores each transaction in the Payments table
- Demonstrates OOP and database connection

## Files
- config.py → database setup  
- db.py → MySQL connection  
- transaction_service.py → business logic for transactions  
- run_transaction.py → demo script for the feature
